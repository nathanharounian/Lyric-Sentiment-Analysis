"No Line On The Horizon","2009","Cedars Of Lebanon","Yesterday I spent asleep, woke up in my clothes in a dirty heap Spent the night trying to make a deadline Squeezing complicated lives into a simple headline I have your face in an old polaroid Tidying the children's clothes and toys You're smiling back at me, took the photo from the fridge Can't remember whatever we did Haven't been with a woman, it feels like it's been years Thought of you the whole time, your salty tears This shitty world sometimes produces a rose The scent of it lingers but then it just goes Return the call to home. The worst of us are a long, drawn out confession The rest of us are geniuses of compression. You say you're not gonna leave the truth alone I'm here 'cause I don't wanna go home. Child drinking dirty water from the riverbank Soldier brings oranges he got out from a tank Waiting on the waiter, he's taking a while to come Watching the sun go down in Lebanon Return the call to home. I got a head like a lit cigarette. Unholy heads reflect in a minaret? You're so high above me, higher than everyone Where are you in the Cedars of Lebanon? Choose your enemies carefully 'cause they will define you Make them interesting, 'cause in some ways they will mind you They're not there in the beginning but when your story ends Gonna last with you longer than your friends X-man's Back!"

I was young Not dumb Just wishing to be blinded By you Brand new And we were pilgrims on our way I woke up at the moment when the miracle occurred Heard a song that made some sense out of the world Everything I ever lost, now has been returned In the most beautiful sound I'd ever heard. We got language so we can't communicate Religion so I can love and hate Music so I can exaggerate my pain, and give it a name I was young Not dumb Just wishing to be blinded By you Brand new And we were pilgrims on our way I woke up at the moment when the miracle occurred Heard a song that made some sense out of the world Everything I ever lost, now has been returned In the most beautiful sound I'd ever heard. We can hear you We can hear you We can hear you I woke up at the moment when the miracle occurred I get so many things I don't deserve All the stolen voices will someday be returned The most beautiful sound I'd ever heard Your voices will be heard Your voices will be heard"

If you go your way and I go mine Are we so... Are we so helpless against the tide? Baby, every dog on the street Knows that we're in love with defeat Are we ready to be swept off our feet And stop chasing every breaking wave? Every sailor knows that the sea Is a friend made enemy And every shipwrecked soul knows what it is To live without intimacy I thought I heard the captain's voice But it's hard to listen while you preach Like every broken wave on the shore This is as far as I could reach If you go... If you go your way and I go mine Are we so... Are we so helpless against the tide? Baby, every dog on the street Knows that we're in love with defeat Are we ready to be swept off our feet And stop chasing every breaking wave? The sea knows where are the rocks And drowning is no sin You know where my heart is The same place that yours has been We know that we fear to win And so we end before we begin Before we begin If you go... If you go your way and I go mine Are we so... Are we so helpless against the tide? Baby, every dog on the street Knows that we're in love with defeat Are we ready to be swept off our feet And stop chasing every breaking wave?"

"Songs Of Experience","2017","The Showman (Little More Better)","Baby's crying cause it's born to sing Singers cry about everything Still in the playground falling off a swing But you know that I know Walk through the room like a birthday cake When I am all lit up, I can't make a mistake And there's a level of shallow that you just can't fake But you know that I know Oh, you don't care But you know I'm there You think you look so good A little more better Look so good Just a little more, little more Look so good That's what's gonna get you Look so good Just a little more, little more You know you're chasing the sunlight That's why I'm staying up all night You think you look so good A little more better Look so good A little more It is what it is but it's not what it seems This screwed up stuff is the stuff of dreams I got just enough low self esteem To get me where I want to go The showman gives you front row to his heart The showman prays his heartache will chart Making a spectacle of falling apart Is just the start of the show Oh, you don't care But you know I'm there You think you look so good A little more better Look so good Just a little more, little more Look so good That's what's gonna get you Look so good Just a little more, little more I'll be chasing the sunlight That's why I'm staying up all night I lie for a living, I love to let on But you make it true when you sing along You think you look so good A little more better Look so good Just a little more, little more Look so good That's what's gonna get you Look so good Just a little more, little more You think you look so good A little more better Look so good Just a little more, little more Look so good That's what's gonna get you Look so good Just a little more, little more"
"Songs Of Experience","2017","The Little Things That Give You Away","The night gave you song A light had been turned on You walked out in the world Like you belong there As easy as a breeze Each heart was yours to please Is it only me who sees There's something wrong there Oh, I'm not a ghost there I can see you You need to see me It's the little things that give you away The words you cannot say Your big mouth in the way It's the little things that tease and betray As the hunted I become the prey It's the little things The little things that give you away I saw you on the stairs You didn't notice I was there That's 'cause you were talking at me Not to me You were high above the storm A hurricane being born What was freedom it might cost you your liberty It's the little things that give you away The words you cannot say Your big mouth in the way It's the little things that tease and betray As the hunted I become the prey It's the little things The little things that give you away Sometimes I can't believe my existence See myself on a distance I can't get back inside Sometimes The air is so anxious All my tasks are so thankless And all of my innocence has died Sometimes I wake at four in the morning Where all the doubt is swarming And it covers me in fear Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes... Sometimes Full of anger and grieving So far away from believing That any song will reappear Sometimes The end is not dawning It's not coming The end is here Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes... Sometimes I'm full of anger and grieving So far away from believing That any song will reappear Sometimes The end isn't coming It's not coming The end is here Sometimes"
